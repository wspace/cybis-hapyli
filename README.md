# The HaPyLi Programming Language

HaPyLi is a programming language designed to compile to
[Whitespace](https://web.archive.org/web/20150717203521/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk:80/whitespace/index.php).
Its syntax was derived from <ins>Ha</ins>skell, <ins>Py</ins>thon, and
<ins>Li</ins>sp, hence the name.
